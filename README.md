# Pac-man Unity Game

This is a simple Pac-Man game developed in Unity as part of the Mobile Development course.

The game consists of two levels, with higher difficulty on the 2nd level. 

Collect all the cookies while evading ghosts! Which can walk through the walls...as ghosts should, you know...it's a feature, not a bug.

Find a cherry for the Pac-Man to temporarily become a ghostbuster and get rid of those annoying little creatures.
